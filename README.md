# The Social Node
*A voluntary side-channel for reinvesting blockchain value into the public good.*

A reflective, voluntary proposal for using a side-channel on blockchain networks to reinvest part of value creation into long-term public good infrastructure.

## 🌐 Core Ideas
- Voluntary rebalancing of value flows
- Transparent, opt-in contribution mechanism
- Independence from political or corporate control
- Tools for climate, education, research, and equity

## 📜 Summary
The Social Node is not a fork or a protocol upgrade. It is an optional module — a simple, clean mechanism that invites those who want to contribute to building a better future, without imposing anything on others.

Inspired by Gitcoin, KlimaDAO, sovereign wealth principles — and the spirit of decentralization.

Fork it. Ignore it. Use it. Improve it.

It’s not a master plan. Just a gesture.
